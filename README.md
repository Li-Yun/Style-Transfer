# Style-Transfer

This repo is a simple implementaion of performing image style transformation in PyTorch. This is an exercise in the Udacity course, Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch. Speficially, I take a pre-trained VGG-19 model as a feature extractor and use it to extract content and style features from a content and style image, respectively. The transferred image is crafted in a way minimizing the content and style loss.
